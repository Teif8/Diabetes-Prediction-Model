# Diabetes-Prediction-Model

This repository contains a machine learning model to predict the onset of diabetes in patients based on certain medical parameters. The model is built using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be applied to healthcare data to make predictions. Specifically, we use logistic regression to classify whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on input features.

### Features:
- Data collection and preprocessing
- Model building using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation of the model's performance using accuracy score

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook notebooks/diabetes.ipynb
    ```

## Dataset
This project uses a diabetes dataset, which contains features such as:
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Age

## Model
We use Logistic Regression as the machine learning algorithm to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.
